I’m a composer originally from Chicago, U.S.A., now based in Berlin, Germany. I studied Music Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and have been working as a freelance musician and composer ever since. With a background in classical performance, composition, theory, and orchestration, my work blends traditional influences with modern textures and soundscapes.

I’m comfortable working across a wide range of styles and always strive to find the right sound for each project, be it grandiose romantic orchetration, modern cinematic soundscapes, intimate chamber music, or anything in between. Whether writing for live musicians or crafting lifelike performances with virtual instruments, I bring depth and authenticity to every piece. If you’re looking for a composer committed to collaboration and detail, I would love to help bring your vision to life.
