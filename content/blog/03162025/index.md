## Bruckner's 9th and Mahler's 9th

It took me some time to warm up to Bruckner's symphonies. The sheer length of his pieces and the jagedness between his themes used to turn me off, but today I find it addictive, and the vastness, a portal to worlds to get lost inside of. And his use of the brass is second to none. I heard his 6th Symphony performed recently by the Rundfunk Sinfonie Orchester in Berlin under the direction of Christoph Eschenbach and the brass nearly knocked me off my seat. 

Today, I would like to look at what seems to me a curious example of compositional imitation. I wish to discuss his unfinished 9th symphony, and how it seems to anticipate the piece that made me fall head over heels in love with orchestra music in the first place: Mahler's 9th symphony.

Bruckner composed his 9th symphony between 1887 and 1896, the year of his death, while Mahler composed his 9th between 1908 and 1909, two years before his death. Mahler was a student and great admirer of Bruckner, considering him a sort of trailblazer of harmony, tonality, and modulation, pushing and stretching those musical fundamentals in ways that he would also do in his own works.

It comes as no surprise to me, then, to notice some striking similarities between passages in each of their colossal 9th symphonies.

Take the *Adagio* movements of each- the 3rd movement of Bruckner's, and the 4th of Mahler's, but the finale for both (as intended for Mahler, and simply as performed for the interrupted Bruckner). Both movements open with a singing melody on the rich G-string of the violins- cantabile, poignant, and opening with a big leap. Bruckner goes a minor 9th, overstepping the octave before coming back from C to B, then falling again out of stability to an A#, where the melody then descends down the octave again and continues.

Mahler's Adagio opens with an octave jump from Ab to Ab, again on the G-string, before chromatically cascading around the note- up to B double flat, back to Ab, down to G, then back up to Ab. This wave-like motif creates a dizzying pull throughout the movement, the chromatic steps often turning expected harmonies from major to minor (and vice versa).
