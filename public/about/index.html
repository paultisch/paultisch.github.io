	<meta name="description" content="I’m a composer originally from Chicago, U.S.A., now based in Berlin, Germany. I studied Music Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and have been working as a freelance musician and composer ever since. With a background in classical performance, composition, theory, and orchestration, my work blends traditional influences with modern textures and soundscapes.
Versatility is at the heart of my approach— I’m comfortable working across a wide range of styles and always strive to find the perfect sound for each project, be it sweeping Mahlerian orchetration, gritty and caustic punk rock, or a warm, intimate solo piano. Whether crafting music for live musicians or achieving lifelike performances with virtual instruments, I focus on bringing depth and authenticity to every piece. If you’re looking for a composer who’s committed to collaboration and detail, I’d love to help bring your vision to life." />
