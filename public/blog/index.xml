      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;welcome-to-the-first-blog-post&#34;&gt;Welcome to the first blog post&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my blog! Are blogs still a thing in 2025? Does anyone still read them? Either way, I intend to write weekly posts about curiosities I notice in music, lessons I learn in composition, software tips and tutorials, etc&amp;hellip; I hope you will find something of value in it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-composers-toolbag&#34;&gt;The Composer&amp;rsquo;s Toolbag&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Music composition, and especially orchestration, are traditional crafts in which one learns reliable ways to make the music achieve its intended effect. The artist can inject beauty and emotion from their heart into the heart of the piece, but without well-developed craft, their ideas mostly remain unrealized and unfulfilled. Besides learning the fundamentals of compositional craft: motivic construction, thematic development, form, harmony, etc., we also collect little nuggets of ideas along the way, which we can then selectively deploy to reliably contribute some desired effect in our music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
